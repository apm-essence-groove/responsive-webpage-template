    # --- FIX: Simplified escaping for GITHUB_OUTPUT ---
    # GitHub Actions typically handles multiline output directly if printed line by line
    # or if the variable contains literal newlines.
    # The previous string replacements were likely double-escaping.
    
    # Ensure the content has literal newlines for the output file
    final_content_for_output = apps_md_content.replace("\\n", "\n") 
    
    # Write directly to $GITHUB_OUTPUT file for clean multiline output
    # Each print statement adds a new line, so ensure format is 'key=value'.
    # GitHub Actions will then handle the decoding of content_type=text/plain; for multiline.
    
    # The most reliable way for multiline output is to set a variable directly in the workflow's run command
    # using a specific syntax, or using a temporary file.

    # Let's revert to a simpler, more direct way of setting the output,
    # as the previous complex escaping was the cause of garbled text.
    # We will rely on GitHub Actions' recent improvements for multiline string outputs.
    
    # For GITHUB_OUTPUT, the value *must* be a single line.
    # Therefore, we still need to replace newlines with %0A etc.
    # However, the previous `sed` commands might have been compounding the issue.

    # Let's ensure the Python script creates the *final escaped string* properly.
    # The initial `apps_md_content` uses `\n` which Python converts to literal newlines.
    # For the `GITHUB_OUTPUT` file, these newlines must be re-escaped.

    # This escape is actually necessary for `GITHUB_OUTPUT` to parse multiline strings correctly.
    # The problem might have been in the Bash script then, when it consumed it.
    
    # Let's make sure the script explicitly adds the `\n` to the end of the line for output,
    # and then encodes it. The issue may have been with `sed` or `echo` in the Bash script.
    
    # --- Corrected escaping for GITHUB_OUTPUT from Python ---
    # Python strings use '\n' for newline. When passing to GITHUB_OUTPUT, this needs conversion.
    # %0A is the correct escape for a newline in GITHUB_OUTPUT variable values.
    # %25 is the correct escape for a literal '%' character.
    final_escaped_content = apps_md_content.replace("%", "%25").replace("\n", "%0A").replace("\r", "%0D")
    
    # Write directly to $GITHUB_OUTPUT file
    with open(os.environ["GITHUB_OUTPUT"], "a") as output_file:
        output_file.write(f"apps_md_section_content={final_escaped_content}\n")
        output_file.write(f"apps_md_updated_flag={str(apps_updated_flag).lower()}\n")
