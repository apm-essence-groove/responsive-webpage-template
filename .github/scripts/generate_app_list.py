    # FIX: Corrected escaping for GITHUB_OUTPUT. 
    # Python's default string escaping for GITHUB_OUTPUT is usually fine,
    # but the previous sed commands were problematic.
    # The key is to avoid unnecessary escaping and let GitHub Actions handle it.
    
    # We will write directly to the GITHUB_OUTPUT file, ensuring each key-value pair is on its own line.
    with open(os.environ["GITHUB_OUTPUT"], "a") as output_file:
        # Encode newlines for GITHUB_OUTPUT as it expects a single-line string.
        # Use Python's replace for explicit encoding if needed, or let GitHub handle it.
        # Let's try direct print, as GitHub Actions often handles this itself.
        
        # Simpler and more direct output without sed replacements:
        # GitHub Actions typically handles the %0A, %0D, %25 internally for multi-line outputs
        # when you print to stdout or write directly to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
        # The previous sed commands were re-escaping, leading to garbled text.
        
        # First, ensure the content itself has literal newlines for the file,
        # then rely on GitHub's built-in output mechanism.
        
        # Replace Python's '\n' with literal newlines for the output file
        # and then let GHA handle its internal escaping for app_dirs_json:
        apps_md_content_for_output = apps_md_content.replace("\\n", "\n") 
        
        # For multiline output, GitHub recommends using `\n` in Python and letting it handle it,
        # or using a temporary file. Since we need to assign it to an environment variable in the shell,
        # manual encoding is often safer.

        # Re-introducing the recommended escaping for GITHUB_OUTPUT, which was previously correct
        # but might have been applied multiple times, leading to issues.
        # The Python script handles the initial generation of content, then escapes it for output.
        escaped_content = apps_md_content.replace("\n", "%0A").replace("\r", "%0D").replace("%", "%25")
