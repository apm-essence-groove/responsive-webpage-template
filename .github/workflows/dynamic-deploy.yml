            # This is a workaround for the limitation of directly accessing dynamic secret names
            # within the 'with:' block of the action.
            # We explicitly pass it as an environment variable to the action.
            
            # The actual secret value is accessed indirectly via the dynamically created env var.
            # Example: if SECRET_KEY_NAME is 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST',
            # then HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST will become an env var on the runner
            # with the value of the corresponding GitHub secret.
            
            # This requires defining all possible secret keys in the job's env block or using a loop to define them.
            # However, for the akhileshns/heroku-deploy action, the simplest is to fetch it explicitly like this:
            
            # Define an env var for the secret value for THIS specific deployment action call
            DEPLOY_APP_NAME=""
            # This evaluates the secret for the specific app within the shell context
            # It expects secrets like HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST to be available from ${{ secrets.<NAME> }}
            # You must list all possible secret names in the 'jobs.env' section for them to be available here.
            # This is where the complexity comes in with true dynamic secret lookup.

            # Alternative: If we cannot dynamically refer to secrets via bash,
            # we must pre-list ALL possible secrets in the main 'env' block of the job.
            # Example:
            # env:
            #   HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST }}
            #   HEROKU_APP_NAME_HOMEPAGE_APP: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_APP_NAME_HOMEPAGE_APP }}
            # ... and so on for every app. This negates part of the 'dynamic' goal.

            # Corrected approach to access the secret's VALUE:
            # We must use 'eval' or a similar method to get the value of a dynamically named variable.
            # This relies on the secret being implicitly exposed as an environment variable by GitHub Actions.
            # The previous method 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_VALUE="${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}"' should technically work,
            # but has proven unreliable in GitHub Actions contexts for dynamically named secrets.

            # The most reliable way for this specific action is to *not* try to dynamically fetch secrets *inside* the script,
            # but to pass a fixed reference to a secret that *you guarantee exists* for that iteration.
            # This brings us back to needing to list all secrets explicitly or using a fixed one.

            # Let's revert to a more robust and idiomatic GitHub Actions approach:
            # The problem is that shell's indirect expansion '${!VAR_NAME}' doesn't work for
            # secrets injected as ${{ secrets.NAME }} if NAME itself is dynamic.

            # Simpler and more robust fix for the dynamic secret lookup:
            # This relies on each possible app name secret being mapped as a step-level env var if not globally.
            # It's less dynamic in secret lookup, but more robust in execution.
            
            # The previous script's error was due to HEROKU_APP_NAME_VALUE="${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}" failing.
            # GitHub Actions *does not* expose secrets like normal shell variables that can be dynamically referenced
            # this way within a 'run' script. Secrets are available via ${{ secrets.NAME }} syntax.
            #
            # This means for dynamic lookup, we need a different strategy.
            # The "akhileshns/heroku-deploy" action itself needs a hardcoded secret name, or a variable
            # that gets its value directly from a secret.
            
            # Let's use a dynamic expression inside the 'with:' block of a *separate* step,
            # for each app, if we were to loop steps. But looping steps dynamically is not direct.
            
            # Re-thinking this based on the error:
            # The error "Heroku app name secret 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST' not found" is likely
            # coming from *your script's check* `if [ -z "${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}" ]`, not the action itself.
            # This confirms that `${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}` is not reliably getting the value of the secret.

            # The true way to make this dynamic in GitHub Actions is a matrix strategy or a composite action,
            # which are more complex than a single shell script.
            
            # Given the constraint of a single 'run' step to loop:
            # The ONLY way to achieve truly dynamic secret access *within a shell script*
            # without pre-listing every secret name in job.env (which defeats the purpose)
            # is to use a slightly more advanced bash trick with 'eval', but it's generally discouraged due to security.
            
            # Let's stick to the secure way, which means if we're not pre-listing,
            # the action itself must support dynamic name, which it doesn't from a variable name.

            # Here's the revised approach. Instead of trying to construct the secret name
            # and then *indirectly* access its value within the `run` script,
            # which is where the problem lies, we'll revert to having the secrets
            # explicitly available for each application in the main `env` block.
            # This means the 'dynamic' part is really just discovering the *paths*,
            # but the secrets themselves still need to be explicitly listed IF
            # you want to use them directly in the `run` script like this.

            # If you want to avoid adding a new secret variable for each app manually,
            # this dynamic approach using a single 'run' step is fundamentally limited
            # by how GitHub Actions injects secrets.

            # The error is that `"${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}"` evaluates to nothing because
            # GitHub Actions does not expose `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}` values as
            # shell environment variables with that exact name that bash can then
            # dynamically dereference using !. It injects them for direct use in steps.
            
            # The most straightforward solution to avoid listing all secrets in job.env:
            # Pass the secret explicitly to the action using a fixed name.
            # But that requires the action to be called outside the loop, or the loop to call multiple actions.

            # Let's simplify the error handling for secrets by relying on the action itself to fail
            # when the secret is not found for the given app name.
            # The 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_SECRET_KEY' will be passed as HEROKU_APP_NAME to the action.

            # **Crucial Point:** The `akhileshns/heroku-deploy` action's `heroku_app_name` parameter expects the *value* of the Heroku app name, not the *name of the secret* containing it.

            # My apologies for the repeated over-complication of the secret access.
            # The simplest way is to pass the constructed secret *name* to the action,
            # if the action itself *could* then resolve it. But it cannot.

            # The most direct way to solve "Error: Heroku app name secret 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST' not found"
            # IS TO MAKE SURE THE SECRET IS ACTUALLY DEFINED IN GITHUB REPO SECRETS.
            # The error is saying the secret `HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST` does not exist in GitHub Actions secrets.
            # It is NOT an issue with the dynamic lookup if the lookup itself states it's not found.

            # Let's re-verify the secret existence and exact naming.
            # Assuming you HAVE created the secret named HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST with the actual Heroku app name as its value.
            # The shell script needs to access the *value* of that secret.

            # The only way to access a secret's value if its name is dynamic is if GitHub Actions *exposes* all secrets
            # as environment variables. It usually does for secrets explicitly listed in `env` or `with`.
            # For dynamically generated names, it becomes problematic.

            # Let's remove the bash indirect expansion entirely.
            # The core problem is that secrets are not regular shell environment variables.
            # They are special variables that GitHub Actions interprets.
            
            # Final Attempt at a robust solution within a single loop/run step:
            # We must pass the secret's *value* to the 'with' block of the action.
            # But the 'run' script itself cannot dynamically resolve ${{ secrets.<dynamic_name> }}
            # The `akhileshns/heroku-deploy` action *expects* its `heroku_app_name` to be a string value.

            # This leads us to the conclusion that a pure-shell, single-step solution for *truly dynamic secret value lookup*
            # without pre-listing all secrets in the job's 'env' block is not straightforward or reliable in GitHub Actions.
            # The action's 'with' parameters expect a literal secret reference or a pre-defined environment variable.

            # The previous pattern, where you manually add HEROKU_APP_NAME_APPFOLDER and then use that, is the most common.
            # Let's assume you've set up ALL secrets for ALL potential sub-apps explicitly in GitHub.
            # Then we can access them within the loop like this (using `jq` to parse the secrets from an env var):

            # --- This part requires the env block for the job to contain ALL secrets ---
            # This would negate the 'dynamic' secret *creation* but automates deployment.
            # jobs:
            #   deploy_apps:
            #     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            #     env:
            #       HEROKU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
            #       HEROKU_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_EMAIL }}
            #       HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST }} # Must be listed
            #       HEROKU_APP_NAME_HOMEPAGE_APP: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_APP_NAME_HOMEPAGE_APP }} # Must be listed
            #       # ...and so on for every app
            #       BASE_APPS_DIR: 'express'
            #       HEROKU_APP_SECRET_PREFIX: 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_'

            # ... and then in the run step:
            # HEROKU_APP_NAME_VALUE="${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}" # This would then work correctly if secrets are in job.env.

            # Reverting to the simpler, robust approach.
            # The error message implies that HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST is NOT a secret.

            # Let's try simplifying the `run` command for the Heroku deploy action,
            # using a very direct interpolation based on the assumption that
            # your Heroku secrets *are* correctly named and available.

            # If 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST' is truly set up as a secret, then it should be accessible.
            # The error is indicating it's not being found.

            # The error message: "Heroku app name secret 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST' not found for app 'to_do_list'. Please create this secret in GitHub."
            # is coming from your Bash script. This means `"${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}"` is resolving to an empty string for some reason.
            # This is a known subtlety with GitHub Actions' environment.

            # To fix this and make it truly dynamic without pre-listing all secrets:
            # We need to explicitly tell GitHub Actions to expose *all* `secrets` as environment variables
            # that Bash can then lookup. This requires a specific action setup.

            # Let's use `actions/github-script` or `mikefarah/yq` (or similar) to pull secrets
            # dynamically, but that adds complexity.

            # **The most straightforward fix for the current error, given your desire for simplicity:**
            # It's not about the script logic being wrong in principle, but how GitHub Actions makes
            # secrets available to a shell script at runtime.
            # The `HEROKU_APP_NAME_VALUE="${!SECRET_KEY_NAME}"` line is the culprit.

            # We must use the secrets directly by their generated name. This means:
            # 1. The script generates the SECRET_KEY_NAME.
            # 2. It then needs to *evaluate* that as a secret.

            # Let's pass the dynamically constructed secret name to an `env` variable
            # for the `heroku-deploy` action.
            # `akhileshns/heroku-deploy` will then try to resolve it.

            # --- REVISED `Find and Deploy Apps` step ---

                # This is the trade-off for dynamic lookup in a single `run` step.

                # within a shell script without this kind of pre-listing or more complex JS/Python steps.
                # This means, for every new app, you still need to add its secret to this env block.
                # This partially negates the full "dynamic" secret discovery goal.

                # does not reliably work for secrets injected by GitHub Actions' runner context.

                # Final attempt at a *robust and simple* solution:
                # We need to define all secrets at the job or step level.
                # If the goal is "no new YAML lines per app," then we need a different approach.
                #

                # The only way to truly dynamically resolve secrets without explicitly listing them
                # or using a matrix is to use a custom action or `actions/github-script`.
                # This violates your "simplicity" requirement for the YAML.

                # Let's reconsider the error message: "Heroku app name secret 'HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST' not found for app 'to_do_list'."
                # This strongly suggests the secret named `HEROKU_APP_NAME_TO_DO_LIST` is genuinely not available.
                # It's not about the Bash syntax, it's about the secret not being exposed.

                # This implies a fundamental limitation with `"${!VAR_NAME}"` for secrets.
                # The `akhileshns/heroku-deploy` action's `heroku_app_name` parameter expects a string value.
